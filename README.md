# Thin circular microplastic disk detection 

This project implements a custom Hough Transform to detect thin circular microplastic particles in digital microscope images.
The experimental setup consists of translucent microplastic disks placed in a water-filled petri dish. 
A USB-connected digital microscope captures top-view images of the samples, illuminated from below by a homogeneous light source.
In this experiment, the microplastic disks have a diameter of approximately 5 mm.
The experimental setup is shown at ![Experimental Setup](experimental_setup.png)      


## üîç Overview

![System Flowchart](flowchart.png)

The system operates by:

1. **Input image resizing** using cv2.resize(), to reduce computational load
2. **Gaussian derivative calculation** using DoG filters, to extract image gradients
3. **Non-maxima Suppression** on non-edge pixels in gradient directions, to sharpen edges
4. **Thresholding** by setting a certain value, to filter out weak edges
5. **Excessive edge pixel elimination** for clusteresd edge points 
6. **Voting array development** to store possible circle center and radius coordinates
7. **Largest votes picking** of n-candidates
8. **Resulting image plotting** with matplotlib.pyplot.imshow()
9. **Microplastic particle quantity declaration** using the print() function
